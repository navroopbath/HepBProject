  As a HepB volunteer
  So that I can change informating about upcoming events
  I want to be to edit events and remove volunteers

Background: members and events have been added to database

 Given John is in the database with the following information:
  | first_name   | last_name  | grad_date                | phone       | email                 | password    | is_admin | warnings |
  | Bob          | Builder    | 2015-05-18 09:30:00.000  | 8888888888  | bobbuilder@gmail.com  | 12345678    | false    |    0     |
  | Tom          | Train      | 2015-05-18 09:30:00.000  | 4088888888  | tomtrain@gmail.com    | 12345678    | false    |    0     |
  | John         | Blume      | 2015-05-18 09:34:00.000  | 5555555555  | johnBlume@gmail.com   | 12345678    | true     |    0     |

  And the following events exist:
  | event_name | location | date                    | duration | num_volunteers | description | start_time              | end_time                |

    And I follow ""
    Then I should see "You have successfully removed Bob Builder from Clinic."
